An extendible and configurable PDF manipulation layer library written in Java. A ready to use java library to perform PDF document manipulation without having to deal with the low level API.

Sejda offers many "ready to go" manipulations implemented using iText, iText 5.x, PDFBox, ICEpdf and [SAMBox](https://github.com/torakiki/sambox), a PDFBox fork that we maintain, and it can be configured to use any of them but you can also provide your implementation and configure Sejda to use it.
