mvn release:perform -Darguments="-Dgpg.passphrase=secret123 -Psonatype-oss-release"

* Post release steps

1) log in to OSS Nexus and close the staging repository. Log in at https://oss.sonatype.org/ with username sejda, click "Staging Repositories". Select the last release performed (should be Open) and perform 'Close'. You expect no validation error and a successful close. After that, you can do 'Release', BEWARE this is a point of no return for Maven Central binaries.

2) push changes from the /tmp/sejda-release-staging/sejda to your workspace repository, and then from there upstream to bitbucket.
3) upload released binaries to bitbucket download page:
3a) - console binaries: /tmp/sejda-release-staging/sejda/target/checkout/sejda-console/target/sejda-console-*-bin.zip
3b) - zip containing all jars for the rest of the modules: /tmp/sejda-release-staging/sejda/target/checkout/sejda-distribution/target/sejda-distribution-*-bin.zip
3c) - upload javadocs to website "
