Release howto

* Release another snapshot version to OSS Sonatype

mvn clean deploy -Psonatype-oss-snapshots

* Maven release

mvn release:prepare -DautoVersionSubModules=true
mvn release:perform

Public release? Do you want to publish binaries to Maven Central?
mvn release:perform -Darguments="-Dgpg.passphrase=secret123 -Psonatype-oss-release"

* Post public release steps
1a) log in to OSS Nexus and close the staging repository. Log in at https://oss.sonatype.org/ with username sejda, click "Staging Repositories". Select the last release performed (should be Open) and perform 'Close'. You expect no validation error and a successful close. After that, you can do 'Release', BEWARE this is a point of no return for Maven Central binaries.
1b) hg push release changes (by default the release process does not push)
2) upload released binaries to bitbucket download page:
3a) - console binaries: <sejda dir>/target/checkout/sejda-console/target/sejda-console-*-bin.zip
3b) - zip containing all jars for the rest of the modules: <sejda dir>/target/checkout/sejda-distribution/target/sejda-distribution-*-bin.zip
3c) - upload javadocs to website "
